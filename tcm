-> Free tech is possible.

-> all tech to 25
-> increase build times of large devices
-> include tier-ups with huge science requirement (in a new color)

-> shotgun after oil processing is odd. maybe change? military 3 is prereq for flamers/rockets, so after oil makes sense for them.

SCIENCE PACKS:
1) copper plate + gear wheel (very simple)
2) transport belt + basic inserter (fairly simple)			-> make a little harder?
3) steel + advanced circuit + battery + smart inserter (very hard)	-> make a little easier?
4) alien artefact (super simple?)					-> make really, really hard?
									-> upgradable science packs?
